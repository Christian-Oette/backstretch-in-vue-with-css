# Vue backstretch effect

A backstretch (fullscreen background image effect) without jquery and in combination with vue js.

Example is supposed to show up here https://christian-oette.github.io/backstretch-in-vue-with-css/.

The idea of the project is to focus on one element or section within a picture.
And whenever the size changes for different displays the element is still visible and the rest is cropped.

Checkout the backstretch-header.vue file!

Remark: I am still having some trouble with dynamic props. If you have any suggestion how to fix this, let me know!
